					<p>Agus 6/7 Hydroelectric Power Plant Infrastructure Quality Monitoring System (IQMS) is a software engineering project of the MSU-IIT Information Technology Students.</p>
					<p>Its purpose is to lessen the strenuous task of managing, organizing, storing and monitoring of the Infrastructure Projects in AGUS 6/7 HEPC.</p>
					<p>It introduces new methods in managing, storing and organizing various infrastructure projects in a single dynamic web-based environment. It automatically organizes the infrastructure projects by its userâ€™s preference, stores information on the database and manage users. Also, it displays the looked-for information on the specific infrastructure projects such as project accomplishments, status remarks, inventory of all infrastructure projects and other reports with just a few steps or clicks all within a short amount of time. It also prints the desired output, displays the status of generating units and integrates a user-friendly concept in its user-interface, making it easy to use and provides relevant feedbacks when errors are present.</p>
					<p>In the current system, the releasing of reports are solely done by the Quality/Safety Engineer when a request from the concern investors are acknowledged. In this project, it presents an independent way for the investors to acquire updated reports anytime and anywhere they want within just a few steps or clicks away.</p>
					<p><strong>Its features are:</strong></p>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Offers Data and Information Security</li>
							<li>Automatically Sort and Display List of Infrastructure Projects</li>
							<li>Makes Ready-To-Print Reports</li>
							<li>Straightforward Management of the Infrastructure Projects</li>
							<li>Regulates System Users</li>
							<li>Generates Ready to Print Report Formats</li>
							<li>Provides Status of Generating Units Bulletin Report</li>
						</ul>
