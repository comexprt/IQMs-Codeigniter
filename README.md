A Brief about CodeIgniter

CodeIgniter is a MVC Framework to assist web base application development. It is built on top of PHP. So, PHP has been around for years and it is a growing pain to built and maintain a big web application structure on it. The pain grow much bigger when the team grow. CodeIgniter provide the much needed structure to PHP web application and thus make it a joy to build and maintain.
How ever, CodeIgniter is 'you type what you need' framework unlike CakePHP. It doesn`t facilitate scaffolding (automatically) as a princip.

CodeIgniter already provide the core libraries which can be extended at whim if you wish. Consult the documentation if you inclined so.

By the way, the documentation is awesome too..!

ps: Read more about MVC if you never heard of it. Important!
